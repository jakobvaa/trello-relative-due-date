    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="addmembers">Adding members to board</h2>
				<p>
					Adding a new team member to a board is done by clicking the invite button in the 
					board's toolbar. There are two different member roles available, 
					observer and member. A member will be able to edit, comment and invite 
					other people to the board, while an observer is only able to view and comment. 
					It is useful to keep the number of members limited, otherwise a board's 
					content may be hard to keep track of. For the IEEE CIS Conferences it 
					will be useful to only have a few members, as there are many cards and 
					limiting the number of people with edit permission will make it easier 
					for the General Chair to have an overview of the board. 
				</p>

    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="roles">Assigning Team Members to cards</h2>
				<p>
					It is useful for people to know who is responsible for a specific task throughout
					the planning of the event, and assigning a card to a specific team member 
					is a great way of doing that. A member type user can assign a specific
						card to one of the board's members, regardless of the member being an observer 
						or a member. When someone is assigned a card, that member will automatically 
						receive notifications when changes are made to that card. This also gives that 
						team member an overview over their specific tasks and can plan accordingly.

			<h2 style="padding-top: 20px;
    width: 100%;
    border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray;
    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="labels">Labels</h2>
			<p>
				Labels in Trello is a way of grouping categories of cards together. 
				In the IEEE CIS Conference template labels are used to group cards that 
				are related to a specific chair's tasks. All the financial type cards will 
				have the FC label, and so forth. This makes it easier to assign tasks to 
				team member within the chair's team.

    width: 100%;
    border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray;
    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="filtering">Filtering cards</h2>
			<p>
				Trello allows searching and filtering among the board's cards. By typing 
				<code>f</code> or clicking the <code>Search cards</code> button in the menu, a list of search 
				parameters will become available. It is possible to search for specific 
				cards, but also to search for labels, team members or due date. This 
				feature is especially useful for the specific chairs. The IEEE CIS 
				Conference Template has a lot of cards, and allowing to filter away 
				unrelated cards makes it a little less overwhelming for the chair. It 
				also gives the chair an overview of their team's task distribution. 
			</p>

    width: 100%;
    border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray;
    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="power-up">Relative Due Date Power-Up</h2>
			<p>
				The relative due date power-up was created to allow a card's due date to be
				dependent on another. If the parent card's due date changes, the original 
				card's will also change. That way a General Chair only needs to set the due 
				date of the conference's start date and all tentative dates will be set on 
				the cards that are depending on that card. Almost all the cards in the IEEE 
				CIS Conference Template will have a relative due date, but it is also possible 
				to change som dependencies if that works better for conference planning. 
			</p>
			<h3>Adding a parent to card</h3>
			<p>
				Adding, changing or removing a parent card is easy. By clicking on the
				<code>Relative Due Date</code> button inside the card (see image below).
			</p>
			<img src="../assets/relbutton.png" width="300"/>
			<p>
				This will open a popup in which you can search for the parent card. 
				You can also remove a parent if applicable. 
			</p>
			<img src='../assets/popup.png' width='300'/>
			<p>
				By clicking one of the card names that appear, you will be prompted to define 
				the difference between the parent card and the original card. The difference is 
				how many months before or after the due date of the parent card, the original 
				card's due date will be. If the parent card has a due date, the due date of the 
				original card will change according to the difference set. If the original card 
				has cards that are dependant on it, their due dates will also change.
			</p>
			<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
			<p>
				The IEEE CIS Conference Template can be a little overwhelming, and getting a general
				timeline of when things happen can be hard by looking a the Kanban board.
					Therefore, we created a timeline visualization of the cards on your board. 
					The timeline can be opened by clicking the timeline button on the boards 
					toolbar (see picture) or by clicking the timeline button inside a card. 
			</p>
			<img src='../assets/timelinebtn.png' width='500'>
			<p>
				The timeline can be grouped by week, month or quarterly depending on how compact 
				you want the timeline too look. You can also define the different labels that 
				are shown in the timeline by clicking the cehckboxes in the sidebar. 
			</p>
			<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>
			<p>
				When the date for the conference has been set, a calendar file for the event can be 
				downloaded for the conference. Inside the timeline, you will get the option to 
				download an `ics` file that can be imported to your personal calendar containing 
				the different cards on the board. If you only want the cards that are relevant for 
				a specific label, you can check the boxes and then download the calendar.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want a calendar that is always up to date with the latest changes to the board, 
				you can subscribe to the calendar by copying the url below the download button in 
				the sidebar.
