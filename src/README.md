<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Trello</h2>

Many of our IEEE CIS General Chairs have vast conference organization experience but may need fast access to the latest rules and updated information provided in this tool. Further, many of our General Chairs support bringing on our next generation of conference organisers (CO)s and this tool provides much of the hints and guidelines that our IEEE CIS COs have contributed to over the years. The tool also provides filtering of the information for specific roles. 

The default tool provides

1. An accessible and searchable information source, with all activities listed under suitable themes, including hints and guidelines, IEEE CIS rules and links to further information. 
2. Relative dates. All activities include relative dates wrt key conference dates. The tool provides automatic conversion of such deadlines to actual calendar dates when the key conference dates are entered. 
3. Simplified information view due to the possibility to filter information shown
4. A detailed timeline view for all activities together with the possibility to filter information shown i.e. show only activity for a specific role
5. Option to include the entire timeline or role specific timeline in the users daily calendar. Each activity linking directly back to the activity card in Trello. 

For those GCs that wish to use Trello as an active conference organization tool, linking to slack or google docs or using many of the other functions that Trello provides, the team may purchase suitable business licenses.  More information about this option will be made available on the IEEE CIS Conferences Website.  

<h2 id='setup'>Setting up conference board from template</h2>

In order to get the board running properly, it is useful to contact the IEEE CIS team. They will provide you with a proper team that has the custom built relative due date power-up. When you have received your team page, there is some setup steps that will ensure you get the best experience possible. 

1. Ensure that the power-up is authorized to edit your board, otherwise the due dates will not be generated. You authorize the power-up by clicking the `Authorize Power up` button in the board toolbar. This will open a popup window that will allow the power-up to edit your board. By scrolling to the bottom of the popup window, and clicking `Allow`, the power-up will be authorized.

<h2 id='key-dates'>Add key dates for the Event</h2>


All deadlines in the default tool have been provided as relative dates either to the conference start or
to other key dates i.e. relative to the paper submission deadline.

To add your event dates and update all relative dates to calendar dates, go to the Key Conference
Dates list. First update the Event Start:

* Click on the Event Start card
* Click on the Due date
* Select start date from calendar
* Click Save

Note that the relative dates are still using default deadlines for your other key dates

Update your Event with your approved key dates, following the same process for each card:

* ADCOM Approval received
* Paper Submission Deadline
* Paper Acceptance Deadline
* Camera Copy Deadline

<h2 id='timeline'>Timeline View</h2>

The DEFAULT VIEW is an information view of all the activities grouped into themes. 
The TIMELINE VIEW rearranges the activities in terms of their timing relative to the conference start, 
click the Timeline button on the toolbar (see picture) or 
click the Timeline button on any card.
* To return to the Default View
* Click on any activity (card)



### Adjusting Timeline View

View timing of activities for a specific role (adjusting roles – see labels)

*	Click on role e.g. Finance Chair (FC)

Change the time interval (3 months default):
* Click Weekly (Monthly) Time interval (on the left hand side) 
Reduce number of empty columns (no activity deadlines in those time periode)
* Click Collapse empty columns

<h2 id='calendar'>Calendar</h2>



The timeline view also allows for subscribtion to an event calendar that will be up to date whenever there is a change to the board. This will be possible as long as the Event Start date is set. 

This is done in the following way:

* Inside the timeline view, check the relevant labels that are wanted for the calendar on the left hand side. 
* Click the `Copy Calendar Link To Clipboard` button. This link will contain the calendar that mirrors the timeline view that is filtered on.

<h2 id='members'>Adding members to a board</h2>


To add a new member, 

* Click the Invite button in the board's toolbar. 
* Add the members email address and 
* Select either member or observer.  

A member will be able to edit, comment and invite other people to the board whilst an observer is only able to view and comment. 
It is recommended to have few members, limited to 

*  those that need to be able to edit the board
*  those that need to be able to assign activities/tasks.  

The member or observer invited, will receive the invite, be asked to create a login (if one does not already exist) and asked to join the board.


<h2 id='labels-filter'>Labels: filtering information</h2>

The template includes a number of LABELS for key roles in the conference organization. 
Each role may involve one or more chairs.  
Each activity (card) may have one or more labels ie one or more roles might be commonly involved in such an activity.  
To view the activities for a given role:
 * Type f, choose label (role).

<h2 id='labels-change'>Labels: create, change or delete</h2>

The GC can change the allocation of roles to cards by creating/changing/deleting labels on cards. Further, any ‘member’ of the board has such privileges.

### Create a new label (role):  
* click on menu on the boards toolbar, 
* click more, 
* click labels (can also be accessed from labels button within a card), 
* click create a new label ie a new chair label

### Change the colour/pattern of a label:  
* as above but 
* click on the edit beside the chosen label
* choose colour

### Add or remove a label to a card: 
* click on card, 
* click ‘+’ or labels button (to the right).  
* Click on edit beside label to add or delete from card

<h2 id='tasks'>Assigning tasks</h2>



Labels provide for filtering of information, as stated, providing a simplified tailored view of activities in terms of the key roles in organizing a conference. 
Chairs may wish to assign tasks to other chairs or to their team e.g. local organizing team. 

### To assign an activity(card): 
* Click on the card
* Click on Members button
* Select member(s) or observer(s) from list

Assignees will be notified of any changes to this activity (card).
Any member can assign tasks. For example, the local chair can assign an activity to his local team. His team can be registered as observers. 


### View assigned tasks

A member or observer can view assigned tasks. Further, a chair can get an overview of his/her team's assigned task distribution.
	
Activities (Cards) assigned are marked with a round label with the assignee labels
To filter view to one or more assignees:

* Type `f` or click menu button and `Search cards`
* Click on the given member(s) or observer(s)

<h2 id='search'>Search cards</h2>

To find specific information such as activities with upcoming deadlines, completed or incomplete activities 

* Type `f` or click menu button and Search cards 
* Select relevant parameter from list

To search for a topic

* Type `f` or click menu button and `Search cards` 
* Write in search word(s)



<h2 id='power-up'>Relative Due Date Power-Up</h2>
The relative due date power-up was created to allow a card's due date to be dependent on another – the parent card. The dependency is based on X months prior to or after the deadline for the parent. 

If the parent card's due date is changed, the child cards relative due date to this card will remain unchanged but the calendar date will be automatically adjusted accordingly. For example, when the GC updates the start date card with the calendar date, all child cards will be updated accordingly.  

### Changing the relative date on a card

The GC (or another chair with member status) may wish to adjust the deadline for a given activity. There are two ways to do this. 

1. Change the relative due date

	* Click on Relative due date (under Power-ups to the right)
	* Select the parent card (current parent shown under PARENT at top left of the card ie Paper Submission)
	* Set difference in months i.e. if 1 week set 0.25
	* Click set Relative Due Date

2. Change to fixed calendar date
	*  	Click on Relative due date
	* Select Remove Parent (removes relative date)
	* Click on Due date (on card)
	* Select fixed calendar date
