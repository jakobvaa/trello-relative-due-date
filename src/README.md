<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Trello</h2>

Many of our IEEE CIS Volunteers have vast conference organization experience but may need fast access to the latest rules and updated information, as well as having access to useful hints and guidelines for particular conference organisation activities. Further, support is needed for the important role that our conference organisers play in  training up our next generation of conference organisers.  The IEEE CIS CO-Tool is designed to provide such a valuable information source to meet these needs as well as providing filtering of the information source, tuned to particular conference organiser roles.  

Organising such an event, not only requires access to information, but planning support for the many deadlines involved in the various activities leading up to, during and after  such an event. Due to the introduction of a unique feature in the Conference Organising Tool that allows for relative dates, the default activity deadlines are automatically converted to actual calendar deadlines  for the particular event when the actual key conference dates are added e.g. Event start Date, Paper Sumbmission deadline etc. This feature thus provides the much needed planning support, through a CIS Timeline view of all activities, tuned to the given event. The user can easily swap between the CIS Timeline View and the more detailed CIS Information View for a particular activity in question. 

In summary, the default tool provides

1. An accessible and searchable information source, with all activities listed under suitable themes, including hints and guidelines, IEEE CIS rules and links to further information. 
2. Relative dates. All activities include relative dates wrt key conference dates. The tool provides automatic conversion of such deadlines to actual calendar dates when the key conference dates are entered, both preliminary and IEEE CIS ADCOM approved dates.  
3. A simplified CIS Information View due to the possibility to filter the information shown i.e. show only activity for a specific role.
4. A detailed CIS Timeline View for all activities together with the possibility to filter the information shown. 
5. Option to include the entire timeline or role specific timeline in the users daily calendar. Each activity links directly back to the activity card in the Conference Organisation Tool.  

<h2 id='setup'>Set up your event's board from the template</h2>

1. Create CIS Conference Organising Tool Board for your event

	 * click on CREATE BOARD FROM TEMPLATE
	 * title: insert name of your event (with year)
	 * choose workspace
	 * click create

2. Register your event board with IEEE CIS

	* Contact IEEE CIS Conference Organising Tool Support
	
	Your board will now have both Technical and IEEE CIS Conference Committee support for any questions you may have. 

3. Establish due dates

	A 'power up' has been created by IEEE CIS to enable the default relative dates to be automatically converted to actual calendar dates for your event. Two setup steps are 	needed as follows:  

	a) AUTHORISE the power-up
	
	* click the `Authorize Power up` button in the board toolbar 
	* scroll down the popup window and click 'allow'
 
	<img src='https://i.imgur.com/IsvYLaE.png' width='500'>

	b) ADD Key Dates
	* Go to the Key Conference Dates list. 
	* Update the Event Start card:
	
   		* Click on the Event Start card
   		* Click on the Due date
   		* Select start date from calendar
   		* Click Save

Your other Key Dates will be updated relative to your Event start Date. These dates provide you with suggested deadlines, in keeping with the IEEE CIS conference oragnisers experience. 

When you receive ADCOM approval, you can update your event with all your actual approved key dates, following the same process, as above, for each card:

* ADCOM Approval received
* Paper Submission Deadline
* Paper Acceptance Deadline
* Camera Copy Deadline

<h2 id='timeline'>Timeline View</h2>

The DEFAULT VIEW is an information view of all the activities (cards) grouped into themes (lists). 

The TIMELINE VIEW is a calendar view of all the activities (cards) grouped under their deadlines ( relative dates (in default template), actual dates (for an Event))

To switch from DEFAULT VIEW to TIMELINE VIEW: 
* click the Timeline button on the toolbar (to the right) or click the Timeline button (to the right) on any card.

Top switch from TIMELINE VIEW to DEFAULT VIEW:
* Click on any activity (card) in the timeline. 



### Adjusting Timeline View

View timing of activities for a specific role (for adjusting roles – see labels)

*	Click on role e.g. Finance Chair (FC)

Change the time interval (3 months default):
* Click Weekly (Monthly) Time interval (on the left hand side) 
Reduce number of empty columns (no activity deadlines in those time periode)
* Click Collapse empty columns

<h2 id='calendar'>Calendar</h2>



The timeline view also allows for subscribtion to an event calendar that will be up to date whenever there is a change to the board. This will be possible as long as the Event Start date is set. 

This is done in the following way:

* Inside the timeline view, check the relevant labels that are wanted for the calendar on the left hand side. 
* Click the `Copy Calendar Link To Clipboard` button. This link will contain the calendar that mirrors the timeline view that is filtered on.

<h2 id='members'>Adding members to a board</h2>


To add a new member, 

* Click the Invite button in the board's toolbar. 
* Add the members email address and 
* Select either member or observer.  

A member will be able to edit, comment and invite other people to the board whilst an observer is only able to view and comment. 
It is recommended to have few members, limited to 

*  those that need to be able to edit the board
*  those that need to be able to assign activities/tasks.  

The member or observer invited, will receive the invite, be asked to create a login (if one does not already exist) and asked to join the board.


<h2 id='labels-filter'>Labels: filtering information</h2>

The template includes a number of LABELS for key roles in the conference organization. 
Each role may involve one or more chairs.  
Each activity (card) may have one or more labels ie one or more roles might be commonly involved in such an activity.  
To view the activities for a given role:
 * Type f, choose label (role).

<h2 id='labels-change'>Labels: create, change or delete</h2>

The GC can change the allocation of roles to cards by creating/changing/deleting labels on cards. Further, any ‘member’ of the board has such privileges. 

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/U58zioW.png' width='500'>

### Create a new label (role):  
* click on menu on the boards toolbar, 
* click more, 
* click labels (can also be accessed from labels button within a card), 
* click create a new label ie a new chair label

### Change the colour/pattern of a label:  
* as above but 
* click on the edit beside the chosen label
* choose colour

### Add or remove a label to a card: 
* click on card, 
* click ‘+’ or labels button (to the right).  
* Click on edit beside label to add or delete from card

<h2 id='tasks'>Assigning tasks</h2>



Labels provide for filtering of information, as stated, providing a simplified tailored view of activities in terms of the key roles in organizing a conference. 
Chairs may wish to assign tasks to other chairs or to their team e.g. local organizing team. 

### To assign an activity(card): 
* Click on the card
* Click on Members button
* Select member(s) or observer(s) from list

Assignees will be notified of any changes to this activity (card).
Any member can assign tasks. For example, the local chair can assign an activity to his local team. His team can be registered as observers. 


### View assigned tasks

A member or observer can view assigned tasks. Further, a chair can get an overview of his/her team's assigned task distribution.
	
Activities (Cards) assigned are marked with a round label with the assignee labels
To filter view to one or more assignees:

* Type `f` or click menu button and `Search cards`
* Click on the given member(s) or observer(s)

<h2 id='search'>Search cards</h2>

To find specific information such as activities with upcoming deadlines, completed or incomplete activities 

* Type `f` or click menu button and Search cards 
* Select relevant parameter from list

To search for a topic

* Type `f` or click menu button and `Search cards` 
* Write in search word(s)



<h2 id='power-up'>Relative Due Date Power-Up</h2>
The relative due date power-up was created to allow a card's due date to be dependent on another – the parent card. The dependency is based on X months prior to or after the deadline for the parent. 

If the parent card's due date is changed, the child cards relative due date to this card will remain unchanged but the calendar date will be automatically adjusted accordingly. For example, when the GC updates the start date card with the calendar date, all child cards will be updated accordingly.  

### Changing the relative date on a card

The GC (or another chair with member status) may wish to adjust the deadline for a given activity. There are two ways to do this. 

1. Change the relative due date

	* Click on Relative due date (under Power-ups to the right)
	* Select the parent card (current parent shown under PARENT at top left of the card ie Paper Submission)
	* Set difference in months i.e. if 1 week set 0.25
	* Click set Relative Due Date

2. Change to fixed calendar date
	*  	Click on Relative due date
	* Select Remove Parent (removes relative date)
	* Click on Due date (on card)
	* Select fixed calendar date
